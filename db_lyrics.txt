vanishing face At times he still dreams of a small field he recognizes With a blue sky overhead and nothing else ### Bang Bang ### Now, this isn't the right thing to do Soâ So, let'sâ So, let's go

Mommy come back because it's dark now (Oh-hoho-oh) (Oh-hoho-oh) Take care, take care (Mommy come back because the water's all gone) Somewhere she glows divine, somewhere she wakes alone But you,

because it's dark now) Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left If your mama don't love ya' then the riverbed might Gone, gone, the water's all gone (Mommy come back 'cause the

### I was walking through the counters of a national concern And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean As the merchandise exchanged and money roared And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak Into the paper bag at her side And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind Crying God knows I'm good God knows I'm good God knows I'm good God may look the other way today God knows I'm good God knows I'm good God knows I'm good God may look the other way today Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag Perspiration trickled down her forehead And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder She was led away bewildered and amazed Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter As her escort asked her softly For her name And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady Who had fainted to the whirling Wooden floor Crying God knows I'm good God knows I'm good God knows I'm good Surely God won't look The other way God knows I'm good God knows I'm good God knows I'm good Surely God won't look The other way ### God Only Knows ### If you should ever leave me My life would still go on believe me The world could show nothing to me So what good would living do me God only knows what I'd be without you I may not always love you But as long as there are stars above you You'll never need to doubt it I'll make you so sure about it God only knows what I'd be without you ### Golden Years ### Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop Don't let me hear you say Life's taking you nowhere,

crossed by the rain And I walked on a crooked crutch I strolled all alone through a fallout zone Came out with my soul untouched I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd But when they said sit down, I stood up Ooh-oh, growing up The flag of piracy flew from my mast My sails were set wing to wing I had a jukebox graduate for first mate She couldn't sail but she sure could sing I pushed the B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues With my gear set stubborn on standing I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school Never once gave thought to landing, no And I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd When they said come down, I threw up Ooh-oh, growing up I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere You know it's really hard to hold your breath And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress Well my feet finally took root in the earth But I got a nice little place in the stars And I swear I found the key to the universe In the engine of an old parked car I hid in the mother breast of the crowd But when they said move down, I moved up Oh-oh-oh, don't you know that I'm growing up I said, oh-oh-oh, I can't help it that I'm growing up ###

all your own While troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared Together than alone Ah, here she comes, here she comes Here she comes again The same old painted lady From the brow of a superbrain She'll scratch this world to pieces As she comes on like a friend But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook Could send her home again Now hear this Robert Zimmerman Though I don't suppose we'll meet Ask

refugee Don't leave us with their sanity Ah, here she comes, here she comes Here she comes again The same old painted lady From the brow of a superbrain She'll scratch this world to pieces As she

grieving New love â a boy and girl are talking New words â that only they can share in New words â a love so strong it tears their hearts To sleep â through the fleeting hours of morning Love is careless in its choosing Sweeping over cross a baby Love descends on those defenseless Idiot love will spark the fusion Inspirations have I none Just to touch the flaming dove All I have is my love of love And love is not loving Soul love â the priest that tastes the word and Told of love â and how my God on high is All love â though reaching up my loneliness Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him Love is careless in its choosing Sweeping over cross a baby Love descends on those defenseless Idiot love will spark the fusion Inspirations have I none Just to touch the flaming dove

Under pressure that burns a building down, Splits a family in two, Puts people on streets. That's OK. That's the terror of knowing What this world is about. Watching some good friends screaming, &quot;Let me out!&quot; Tomorrow gets me higher. Pressure on people, people on streets. OK. Chippin' around, kick my brains 'round the floor. These are the days: it never rains but it pours. People on streets. People on streets. It's the terror of knowing What this world is about. Watching some good friends screaming, &quot;Let me out!&quot; Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high! Pressure on people, people on streets. Turned away from it all like a blind man. Sat on a fence, but it don't work. Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn. Why, why, why!? Love, love, love, love, love. Insanity laughs under pressure. We're breaking. Can't we give ourselves one more chance? Why can't we give love that one more chance? Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love? 'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word, And love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night, And love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves. This is our last dance. This is our last dance. This is ourselves. Under pressure. Under pressure. Pressure. ### Under The God ### Skin dance back at the condo Skin heads getting to school Beating on Blacks with a baseball bat Racism back in rule White trash picking up Nazi flags While you was

He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said, &quot;Do it again, do it again.&quot; (Turn around,go back!) His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said, &quot;Do it again, do it again.&quot; (Turn around, go back!) Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you ### Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud ### Solemn-faced The village settles down Undetected by the stars And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep And the last thing on his mind Is the wild-eyed boy imprisoned 'Neath the covered wooden shaft Folds the rope into its bag Blows his pipe of smolders Blankets smoke into the room And the day will end for some As the night begins for one Staring through the message in his eyes Lies a solitary son From the mountain called Freecloud Where the eagle dare not fly And the patience in his sigh Gives no indication For the townsmen to decide So the village dreadful yawns Pronouncing gross diversion As the label for the dog Oh &quot;It's the madness in his eyes&quot; As he breaks the night to cry, &quot;It's really me Really you And really me It's so hard for us to really be. Really you And really me You'll lose me though I'm always really free.&quot; And the mountain moved its eyes To the world of realize Where the snow had saved a place For the wild-eyed boy from Freecloud And the village dreadful cried As the rope began to rise For the smile stayed on the face Of the wild-eyed boy from Freecloud And the women once proud Clutched the heart of the crowd As the boulders smashed down From the mountain's hand And the magic in the stare Of the wild-eyed boy said &quot;Stop, Freecloud  They won't think to cut me down&quot; But the cottages fell Like a playing card hell And the tears on the face of the wise boy Came trembling down To the rumbling ground And the missionary mystic of peace/love Stumbled back to cry among the clouds Kicking back the pebbles From the Freecloud mountain track. ### Wild Is The Wind ### Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do Let me fly away with you For my love is like the wind And wild is the wind, wild is the wind Give me more than one caress Satisfy this hungriness Let the wind blow through your heart For wild is the wind, wild is the wind You touch me I hear the sound of mandolins You kiss me With your kiss my life begins You're spring to me, all things to me Don't you know you're life itself Like the leaf clings to the tree Oh, my darling, cling to me For we're like creatures of the wind And wild is the wind, wild is the wind You touch me I hear the sound of mandolins You kiss me With your kiss my life begins You're spring to me, all things to me Don't you know you're life itself Like the leaf clings to the tree Oh, my darling, cling to me For we're like creatures of the wind And wild is the wind, wild is the wind Wild is the wind, wild is the wind Wild is the wind ### Win ### (Hey, it ain't over) Me, I hope that I'm crazy I feel you driving and you're only the wheel Slow down, let someone love you Ooh, I've never touched you since I started to feel If there's nothing to hide me Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired Somebody lied, I say it's hip To be alive Now your smile is spreading thin Seems you're trying not to lose Since I'm not supposed to grin All you've got to do is win (Ooh, that's all you've got to do) (Ooh, it ain't over) Me, I'm fresh on your pages Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud Life lies dumb on its heroes Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud Someone like you should not be allowed To start any fires Now your smile is spreading thin Seems you're trying not to lose Since I'm not supposed to grin All you've got to do is win (Ooh, that's all you've got to do) (Ooh) It ain't over Now your smile is spreading thin Seems you're trying not to lose Since I'm not supposed to grin All you've got to do is win (Ooh, that's all you've got to do) (Ooh) All you got to do is win (it ain't over, no) And your smile is spreading thin (Ooh, seek and believe in you) It seems you're trying not to lose (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no) Since I'm not supposed to grin (Ooh, that's all you got to do) All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no) (Ooh, seek and believe in you) All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no) Woo-hoo!
